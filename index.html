        <h3>Up To 3,500 Job Cuts Possible At TAP Air Portugal</h3>
        <p>Around one-third of TAP Air Portugalâ€™s workforce is set to lose their jobs under a 3.4 billion-euro ($4.1 billion) rescue package unveiled by the Portuguese government on Friday. This rescue package for the Portuguese national flag carrier will mean that around 3,500 people could lose their jobs. </p>

        <h2 id="KLM"> KLM Hong Kong flight ban </h2>
        <h3> KLM Banned From Hong Kong For 2 Weeks</h3>
        <p>The government of Hong Kong is imposing strict new rules on incoming flights. According to sources, any flight found with even a single COVID-19-positive passenger aboard will have a two-week ban if any other travelers on that same flight fail to comply with pandemic control measures. As a result, KLM has been banned from operating service from Amsterdam and Hong Kong for the two week period from December 4th through December 17th. It should be made clear that the airline is still allowed to operate flights from Hong Kong to Amsterdam. </p>
